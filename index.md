## Thanks for visiting

Most of my work using Git repositories have been done on private, proprietary repositories.
Nevertheless, I've started to share some of the past projects that I've worked on.

I've shared some programs from the old programming language QBASIC to demonstrate that even though
technology has evolved over time, the desire and ambition behind projects such as these have always been
there regardless of the technology. Back then, QBASIC lended itself more towards functional programming.
This was before the time when Object Oriented design entered into the mainstream.

# Past Projects

### Reversi Game in QBASIC

I programmed this fully-functional game in my teenage years. It was one of the bigger projects that I had finished.

### Poker Game in QBASIC

Here is a poker game with a poker engine underneath that is able to detect poker hand strengths and compare against
the opponent. This is the classic poker game (prior to the craze of Texas Hold'em) where after the first round of cards
are dealt, it is possible to exchange cards.
