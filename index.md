## Thanks for visiting

Most of my recent work using Git repositories have been done on private, proprietary repositories.
Nevertheless, I've started to share some of the past projects that I've worked on.

I've shared a couple of programs from the old programming language QBASIC back in my teenage days to demonstrate
that even though technology has evolved over time, the desire and ambition behind projects such as these have
always been there regardless of the technology. Back then, QBASIC lended itself more towards functional programming.
This was before the time when Object-Oriented design entered into the mainstream in languages such as Java and C++.

# Past Projects

### Reversi Game in QBASIC

I programmed this fully-functional and playable game. The concept is simple but it highlights the sophistication of
the intelligence behind determine when the chips need to alternate colour. In terms of code volume, it was one of the
larger projects that I had successfully finished.

### Poker Game in QBASIC

Here is a poker game with a poker engine underneath that is able to detect poker hand strengths and compare against
the opponent. This is the classic poker game (prior to the craze of Texas Hold'em) where after the first round of cards
are dealt, it is possible to exchange cards.
