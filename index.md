## Thanks for visiting

Most of my recent work using Git repositories have been done on private, proprietary repositories.
Nevertheless, I've started to share some of the past projects that I've worked on.

I've shared a couple of programs from the old programming language QBASIC back in my teenage days to demonstrate
that even though technology has evolved over time, the desire and ambition behind projects such as these have
always been there regardless of the technology. Back then, QBASIC lended itself more towards functional programming.
This was before the time when Object-Oriented design entered into the mainstream in languages such as Java and C++.

For something a bit more recent, I've included some screenshots of a JavaScript web gallery that I designed and implemented
back when I was playing around with JavaScript.

# Past Projects

## Reversi Game in QBASIC

I programmed this fully-functional and playable game. The concept is simple but it highlights the sophistication of
the intelligence behind determine when the chips need to alternate colour. In terms of code volume, it was one of the
larger projects that I had successfully finished.

## Poker Game in QBASIC

Here is a poker game with a poker engine underneath that is able to detect poker hand strengths and compare against
the opponent. This is the classic poker game (prior to the craze of Texas Hold'em) where after the first round of cards
are dealt, it is possible to exchange cards.

## Web Gallery in JavaScript

Here are some screenshots from a web gallery that I implemented in JavaScript. Although conceptually very simple, there
are many features to this web gallery that are interesting. This is a fully-functional web gallery with photo descriptions,
thumbnails, themes that does not run on a database, which although leads to several disadvantages, also has some interesting
advantages. For example, the images can be stored anywhere on the internet. That means, that the web gallery can function
with its stock images distributed anywhere on the internet.
