Most of my recent work using Git repositories have been done on private, proprietary repositories.
Nevertheless, I've started to share some of the past projects that I've worked on.

I've shared a couple of programs from the old programming language QBASIC back in my teenage days to demonstrate
that even though technology has evolved over time, the desire and ambition behind projects such as these have
always been there regardless of the technology. Back then, QBASIC lended itself more towards functional programming.
This was before the time when Object-Oriented design entered into the mainstream in languages such as Java and C++.
